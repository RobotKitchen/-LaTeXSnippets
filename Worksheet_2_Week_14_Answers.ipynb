        "# The naive Bayes classifier\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall from the lecture notes that the naive Bayes classifier works as follows. We are trying to approximate an unknown function $$f:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}$$\n",
        "where $\\Omega$ is our feature space and our output space $\\mathcal{O} = \\{c_1, c_2, ... c_K\\}$ is a finite set of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The naive Bayes classifier does this by building a model that assigns the class label $\\hat{y} = c_k$ as follows:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\hat{y} = \\text{argmax}_k p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k)\n",
        "$$\n",
        "i.e., the $k$ that maximises this quantity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, multiplying all the $p(x_i| c_k)$ together is going to give some very small values. Therefore, we can take the log to make it easier to compute:\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "\\hat{y} &= \\text{argmax}_k p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k)= \\text{argmax}_k log(p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k))\\\\\n",
        "&=\\text{argmax}_k log(p(c_k)) + \\sum_i log(p(x_i|c_k))\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\n",
        "If we choose that $p(x_i|c_k)$ is given by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_k$ and variance $\\sigma_k^2$, then we obtain the following expression:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{align}\n",
        "\\hat{y} &=\\text{argmax}_k \\log(p(c_k)) + \\sum_i \\log(p(x_i|c_k))\\\\\n",
        "&= \\text{argmax}_k \\log(p(c_k)) + \\sum_i \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_k\\sqrt{2\\pi}} exp\\left(\\frac{-(x-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma_k}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n",
        "&= \\text{argmax}_k \\log(p(c_k)) - \\sum_i \\log\\left(\\sigma_k\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\right) - \\sum_i\\left(\\frac{(x-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma_k}\\right) \\quad \\text{ log-likelihood}\n",
        "\\end{align}\n",
        "\n",
        "Expressing the values in terms of these sums means that they do not get so small, and it is less likely that there will be errors at the machine precision level.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "How do we implement this in practice? We assume that each probability $p(x_i| c_k)$ is given by some distribution, and then given a datapoint $\\vec{x}$, we plug the value into the equation for the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
